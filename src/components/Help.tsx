        Every day a new country capital is being randomly chosen.
        You can try to find the wanted capital with as few tries as possible.

      <p>
        Every guessed capital will be added to the list which gives you information
        about its distance and direction to the wanted capital.

        <span>Paris - 903 km - ENE ‚ÜóÔ∏è</span>
